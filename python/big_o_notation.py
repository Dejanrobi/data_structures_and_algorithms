"""
A way of quickly describing how an algorithm performs as the dataset its working on increases in size
Lets you compare the best algorithm to choose for your problem

n: number of elements you are operating on

SELECTION SORT
BIG O: O(n2)

QUICK SORT
Best Case
BIG O: O(n log n)

Worst Case
BIG O: O(n2)

Merge Sort
BIG O: O(n log n)


Linear Search
Big O: O(n)

Binary Search
Big O: O(log n)

Big O Notation
Tells you the number of times an operation is performed
Doesn't describe the duration of the operation
A useful tool for describing how the runtime of an algorithm increases as the data set it's operating on gets really, really big.
